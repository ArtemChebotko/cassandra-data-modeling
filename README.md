# Data Modeling by Example

This growing collection of data modeling examples from various domains will help you get started on your own Apache Cassandraâ„¢ database schema design. Each example applies our Cassandra Data Modeling Methodology to produce and visualize four important artifacts: conceptual data model, application workflow model, logical data model and physical data model. Last but not least, the hands-on portion of each example makes it easy to implement a data model in Cassandra, express data access patterns as CQL queries and run the queries against our sample dataset. Get a functioning proof of concept for your use case in minutes!
